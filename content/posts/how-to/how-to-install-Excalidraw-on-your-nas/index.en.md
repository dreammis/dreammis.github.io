## 1. Introduction

Do you often find yourself arguing with your girlfriend through text and voice messages on WeChat over some issues?

Through the screen and the exchange of information through text, it is inevitable that there will be various "misunderstandings" in understanding.

The consequences are:

- ðŸ˜’ Minor ones may lead to the girlfriend leaving.
- ðŸ˜« Major ones may lead to the breakup of a marriage.

So what should you do?

At this time, there is nothing that "one (X)" cannot solve.

I'm referring to "a picture." What you need is "a tool" that can clearly depict your thoughts, rather than words or language.

At this time, Excalidraw can perfectly solve your problem.

## Case Study

Here is an example of how I resolved an unexpected situation with my girlfriend, Zhijian, using a picture.

Throughout the process, without the need for words, you can understand what happened, perfectly solving the communication problem.
