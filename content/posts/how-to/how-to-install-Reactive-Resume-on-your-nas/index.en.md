## 1. Introduction

A resume plays a crucial role in job hunting, applying for schools, or showcasing personal abilities.

Many working individuals may have experienced the frustration of working hard on a resume, only to be rejected by HR due to formatting or template issues.

So, how can you create a professional and appealing resume?

In today's tutorial, I will help you build a service that allows you to easily create, update, and share your resume: Reactive-Resume.

Why do we need to build our own resume generator? There are two main reasons:

- It can meet your personalized resume needs, allowing you to freely adjust layouts, choose colors and templates, and even create resumes with dark mode.
