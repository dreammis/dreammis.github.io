Discover a free, self-hosted survey questionnaire tool to better understand your customers.
<!--more-->


## 1. Introduction

This article might not be for everyone, especially not all NAS users, but it's particularly useful for those who are in the process of starting or about to start a business.

I stumbled upon this tool and couldn't resist sharing it because of its impressive capabilities.

Business, in a nutshell, is about transactions and value exchange. Identifying a problem or pain point, designing a product/service to address it, finding the right audience, and pricing it appropriately.

In other words, making money is about helping others in exchange for compensation.

- Employees help companies achieve greater value through their physical labor, intellect, and time, and are compensated accordingly.
- Delivery personnel use their time and effort to deliver food, assisting both the restaurant and the customer, and receive payment for their service.
- Short video bloggers provide insights or entertainment, attracting traffic, and thus, valuation.

To condense it further, entrepreneurship is simple:

A viable idea -> A feasible implementation -> A reasonable price -> Analysis and improvement

Repeat this cycle for a healthy business project, continuously understanding and catering to your customers' needs, adjusting your direction, solutions, and pricing accordingly.

The biggest headache for entrepreneurs is understanding their customers: finding out what they truly need and guiding them to the lifestyle they desire. This is where a crucial tool comes into play: `survey questionnaires`.

I had a small project and struggled to capture what users really wanted, which led me to explore `survey questionnaire` solutions. Domestic options were available, but even basic webhook functionality was `charged`.

> Webhooks can perform numerous tasks, such as sending a coupon to a customer's phone or email after they complete a survey.

![image-20240506184052546](image-20240506184052546.png)

Filling these out felt tedious. I envisioned a survey tool like `typeform`: simple, intuitive, and clean.

![Typeform2](Typeform-Blog-SurveySchool1-1.png)

However, typeform was too expensive.

So, I sought alternatives and finally discovered **Formbricks**, a self-hostable favorite among NAS users.

Setup Steps:

## 1. Key Points

`Click to follow for free`, and you won't get lost.

## 2. Docker Management Graphic Tool

#### For Synology DSM 7.2 and above, use *Container Manager* directly.

![container-manager-1](container-manager-1.png)

#### For QNAP, use ContainerStation.

![container-station-1](container-station-1.png)

![container-station-2](container-station-2.png)

#### Or install Portainer yourself.

Tutorial reference:
[Install the Essential NAS Tool Portainer in 30 Seconds](/how-to-install-portainer-in-nas/)

Next, we'll use Portainer as an example.

##  3. File Station

Open the docker folder in File Station and create `formbricks`, `postgres`, and `uploads` folders.

![image-20240506185615511](image-20240506185615511.png)

- `postgres` is for storing database files for `formbricks`.
- `uploads` is for storing attachment files for `formbricks`.

## 4. Create a Stack

### Key Parameter Explanation

- WEBAPP_URL: If you're running locally, you don't need to fill this in. For external access, enter your domain name.
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY: Needed for encryption. Ideally, these should be generated via command, but for simplicity, use the provided values.
- SIGNUP_DISABLED: Whether to allow registration. Initially set to allow, as you need to register. Can be disabled later.

For other parts, fill in as needed.

## 6. Success

![portainer-slack-add-success](portainer-slack-add-success.png)

## 7. Usage

Access the program in a browser: [IP]:[Port]

> The IP is your NAS's IP (mine is 172.16.23.106), and the port is defined in the configuration file, 32000 if you followed this guide.

![login](image-20240506190104510.png)

Since I've already registered and set SIGNUP_DISABLED to 1, disallowing registration, you would normally see a registration page here.

After logging in, the interface is calm and clean. I've already completed a survey collection here.

![image-20240506190243282](image-20240506190243282.png)

You can see the survey details, including completion time, start rate, response rate, and drop rate, helping you better evaluate your survey and incentives.

## 8. Special Features Showcase

### Creating a Survey

![image-20240506190503447](image-20240506190503447.png)

### Webhook Settings

![image-20240506190544543](image-20240506190544543.png)

When a survey ends, the URL is sent to this webhook. Here, I'm sending a promised free coupon to users.

The API receiving the webhook is a simple web server written with FastAPI. Don't think it's difficult; with AI's help, you can write it too.
