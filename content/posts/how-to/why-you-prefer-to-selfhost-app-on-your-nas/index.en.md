## Preface

A few days ago, someone asked me:

Why don't you just use ready-made cloud services or mobile apps, and instead go through the trouble of building your own NAS and private services? I often come across posts like "I built a website similar to Tencent Video" or "I built my own NetEase Cloud Music"...

Can't you install an app on your phone? Can't you download software on your computer?

Why?

Today, I won't write a tutorial. I want to answer this question and also address the doubts of other friends.

## Why

### Cost-effectiveness

First of all, let's talk about the cost. Compared to purchasing cloud services, building your own services is `more cost-effective` in the long run.

First, there's `storage`: photos, favorite movies, work and life documents, study materials, etc.

Can I put all of these on the cloud? Of course, but it would be a `huge expense`.

Here are some examples of commonly used services:

| Service (per year) | Price         |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| iCloud 200GB       | ￥252 (21*12) |
| Baidu Cloud 5TB    | ￥188         |
| Alibaba Cloud 8TB  | ￥158         |

A 4TB hard drive costs around 300 yuan, which is roughly the same as the cost of these memberships. There are also numerous video streaming site memberships, memberships for various music apps, and $10 per month for Notion.

There are many paid apps, and some advanced features require payment to unlock. On the other hand, many self-built services can be used for free.

### Self-control

Have you heard of Xunlei KuaiPan, Sina Weipan, UC Weipan, Huawei Weipan, Weiyun, 360 Yun?

These are all `failed cloud storage services`. How many users lost their data because these companies' business operations were not favorable?

"NetEase Youqian" is a personal finance app I use. When I logged in again, it was empty. It turns out there was an announcement telling users that they were shutting down and to transfer their data in a timely manner...

I don't know how many people in the comments lost their data because they used these public services.

This is a major reason for the hassle. I want to decide when to stop using these services, not these companies.

### Multiple Devices and Sharing

The use of multiple devices is also an important reason why I use NAS and self-built services.

I have a Mac, a Windows PC, and Linux. I also have Android and iOS devices. But there are many applications that `don't have as many clients developed for these platforms`.

On the other hand, self-built services are mostly built using the web, which means that as long as you have a `web browser`, you can access them from anywhere.

Photos, movies, and music stored at home `don't rely on any external cloud services` and can be easily used on multiple devices, even among multiple family members.

### Data Security and Privacy

Especially for sensitive data, financial data, and private data, I believe more in self-hosting rather than third-party services.

I don't want to see a vulnerability in a cloud storage service exposing my private photos to the public.

I also don't want others to know how much money is in my bank account.

And I definitely don't want these businesses to use mine and my family's data to "train their models"...

### Speed and Efficiency

Self-hosted services are often more streamlined. Downloading is just downloading, storage is just storage, listening to music is just listening to music, unlike many applications nowadays that have installation packages of several gigabytes.

They want to fit every aspect of life into one app.

With self-hosted services, I can quickly and directly access what I need without going through complex logins and clicking through various processes to find what I want.

Moreover, those who know a little bit know that the speed of a wired connection is much faster than Wi-Fi and mobile networks. I can easily enjoy true 4K at home.

### Hobbies and Challenges

This is also a very important point: I like it.

Money can't buy what I like.

I enjoy the pleasure of building each service. Every time I successfully run a new service, I feel a great sense of accomplishment. Building and maintaining self-hosted servers is a challenge, but also an opportunity for learning and growth.

In the process of configuring and optimizing, I have gained a deeper understanding and mastery of these technologies.

## Drawbacks

In this world, "nothing is absolutely good or bad."

> Is it good to have a cold and fever?
>
> No, it's uncomfortable. I don't feel like doing anything and have no interest in anything.
>
> Yes, it's your body telling you that you need to change your lifestyle. It's your white blood cells actively fighting against bacteria.

Nas and self-hosted services are no exception.

### Learning Cost

You need to learn many things you don't know to ensure the security of your services and data.

### Time Cost

You need a lot of time to debug and solve various problems you have never encountered before.

You also need some time to read my blog, hahaha.

## Conclusion

Whether it's about data control, economics, or a passion for technology, I ultimately choose NAS and self-hosting.
