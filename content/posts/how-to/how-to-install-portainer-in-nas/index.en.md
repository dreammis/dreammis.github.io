Today, I will teach you how to install Portainer, a must-have tool for Nas, in just 30 seconds.

## **How to Build Your Own Weibo**

1. Randomly express your thoughts without worrying about others seeing them.
2. Completely save them on your Nas.
3. Invite your good friends to come and have fun, share funny pictures.

How much trouble do you think this would be? With Portainer, it only takes 2 steps:

## Create a Directory

ðŸ’•**Done!**

> In the future, this channel will share many interesting and fun private services in Nas, all taught simply using Portainer.

Next, let's get to the point of "how to build Portainer in Synology Nas".

The whole process "does not require any code", just use Synology's ["Task Scheduler"](#task-scheduler).

## Introduction to Portainer
Portainer is a lightweight Docker container management tool.

Its advantages are:

1. UI interface (easy operation)
2. Easy deployment (more useful and fun services will be shared in the future)
3. Multi-platform support (Synology, QNAP, Linux, Windows)
4. Easy management (network, images, containers)

With it, we can easily build various services in Nas. In the future, I will also share various services I have built in Nas, and Portainer is indispensable here.

## 7. Check if it is completed (optional step)

> Due to issues with the domestic network, there may be situations where the image cannot be pulled. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm. If it still doesn't work, you can `set up a domestic source`.

Two verification methods - choose one

You can also check if Portainer has been successfully pulled in the `docker suite`
