Welcome to my blog, where I mainly share my experiences, thoughts, and works. You can stay updated with my blog through the [[**RSS**]](https://www.nasdaddy.com/index.xml) feed.

## About Me

Hi! I am **NasDaddy**, an adventurous father. I was born in a small county and currently reside in Hangzhou.

I have been working as a backend developer for over ten years and have tinkered with many things. I enjoy exploring various novel things.

## Why

NasDaddy is a place for me to record my adventures with NAS, servers, and self-hosted services. Here, I mainly discuss interesting NAS applications, tutorials on private clouds, and share my thoughts. I hope my ramblings can also be helpful to you.

## Intention

Doing this is not just a hobby. If it were just a hobby, it might not last long.

So here, I hope to make some friends and help others. Moreover, this is a place where this middle-aged dad can relax and freely express himself.

## More

As one reaches middle age, they have a whole new perspective on many things. Besides NAS, I have also ventured into many other areas. Perhaps we can exchange ideas.

- Psychology

I focus on solving issues such as `anxiety, depression, and procrastination`. For many years, I have been going to bed at 3 am every day. This restless mind torments me daily, so I have learned a lot of knowledge and methods to successfully solve these problems. It has not been a short process.

- Neuroscience

A multidisciplinary field, neuroscience can help people with sleep, health, motivation, and executive function from a neurological perspective.

- AIGC

This is a place I constantly pay attention to and learn from.

- Self-media

In my spare time, I also manage my own self-media in other fields, and I have over 100,000 followers across various platforms.

## Lastly

As people grow older, they become lonelier. I hope that in this vast sea of people, I can make some friends, share a drink, and talk about life.

Humans are social animals. Perhaps most conversations cannot change anything, but in this lifetime, no one has given anyone the meaning of life. All we can do is:

- Seek meaning
- Live in the present
